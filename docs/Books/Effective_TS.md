# Efficient TS

## Chapter 1: Getting to know TS

* TypeScript is an unusual language in that it neither runs in an interpreter (as Python and Ruby do) nor compiles down to a lower-level language (as Java and C do). Instead, it compiles to another high-level language, JavaScript.

### Item1: TS vs JS

* TS superset of JS

### Item2: TS Options

* use `noImplicitAny`
* for `stricNullChecks` add check/narrowing (`if (propertyExists)`) or non-null assertion (`propertyExists!.context`) - #Item9
* use `strict` > üëÄ `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` - #Item48

### Item3: Code is independent of Types

* Cannot check types at runtime
* Interfaces are only types. Classes have type and value, they can be checked at runtime
* Code with type errors can produce output
* `noEmitOnError` to disable output on errors
* Type Operations cannot affect runtime values (`(val) => vas as number`)
* Runtime types may not the same as Declared types. "Unsound" types - #Item 48
* Cannot overload a fn based on TS types (c++ feature). Only works on type level
* You can provide multiple type signatures for a fn, but only a single implementation
* TS no effect on runtime performance (build time - and perfomance overhead vs native eg. generators)

### Item4: Structural Typing

* Ok to have different name types with same structure
* It can cause code errors as types are "open" not precise - #Item63 + #Item64 
* Excess property checking - #Item11
* Iterating over objects - #Item60
* Structural typing can lead to surprises on classes too!
* Can help to abstract dependencies on tests (no mocking libraries necessary) - #Item70

### Item5: Limit `any`

* No type safety
* Allows break contracts
* No language service (no infer, no rename Symbols)
* Masks bugs on refactoring
* Hides type design
* Undermines confidence on the type sys

## Chapter 2: TS type Sys

### Item6: use IDE to explore Type Sys

* `tsc` compiler and `tsserver` standalone server 
* widening (#Item20) narrowing (#Item22)

### Item7: Think of types as sets of values

* correspondence between TypeScript terms and terms from set theory.
* TypeScript types form intersecting sets (a Venn diagram) rather than a strict hierarchy. Two types can overlap without either being a subtype of the other.
* Disclaimer: these are relationships, not TypeScript code!
  
    ```js
    keyof (A&B) = (keyof A) | (keyof B)
    keyof (A|B) = (keyof A) & (keyof B)
    ```
    If you can build an intuition for why these equations hold, you‚Äôll have come a long way toward understanding TypeScript‚Äôs type system!

* `never` bottom type vs `unknown` top type
* types are sets of values and the things you can do with them

### Item8: Symbol is Type Space vs Value Space

* Know how to tell whether you‚Äôre in type space or value space while reading a TypeScript expression. Use the TypeScript playground to build an intuition for this.

* Every value has a static type, but this is only accessible in type space. Type space constructs such as type and interface are erased and are not accessible in value space.

* Some constructs, such as class or enum, introduce both a type and a value.

* typeof, this, and many other operators and keywords have different meanings in type space and value space.

### Item9: Prefer Type Annotations to Type Assertions

* Prefer type annotations (: Type) to type assertions (as Type).

* Know how to annotate the return type of an arrow function.

* Use type assertions and non-null assertions only when you know something about types that TypeScript does not.

* When you use a type assertion, include a comment explaining why it‚Äôs valid.

### Item10: Avoid Object wrapper types

* `String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt` vs `string, number, boolean, symbol, bigInt`

### Item11: Excess Property Checking vs Type Checking

* Excess property checking does not happen when you use a type assertion
* A ‚Äúweak type‚Äù is an object type with only optional properties. For these types, assignability checks require at least one matching property.

### Item12: Apply types to entire Fn expressions

* Use typeof fn to match the signature of another function, or Parameters and a rest parameter if you need to change the return type.

### Item13: type vs interface

* Understand the differences and similarities between type and interface. Know how to write the same types using either syntax. Be aware of declaration merging for interface and type inlining for type. For projects without an established style, prefer interface to type for object types.

### Item14: use readonly

### **Item 15:** Use Type operations and generic types to avoid repeating yourself

* Mapped types: `type Pick<T, K> = { [k in K]: T[k] };`
* `[k in keyof Options]` = Partials `Partial<Options>`
* You can include an as clause in them to rename the keys. There are many uses for this, but one is to invert the keys and values in a mapping: `type LongToShort = { [k in keyof ShortToLong as ShortToLong[k]]: k };`
* If the index clause in your mapped type is of the form K in keyof T or a few variants on it, then TypeScript treats it as a **‚Äúhomomorphic‚Äù** mapped type. 
* The canonical use case for typeof is if you have a single value that you‚Äôd like to be the source of truth for a type (perhaps it‚Äôs some kind of schema or API specification). By making the value the source of truth, you avoid duplication in defining the type.
* `ReturnType<typeof getUserInfo>`

### Item16: Prefer more precise alternatives to Index Signatures

* Index signature: `type Rocket = {[property: string]: string};`
* What should you use index signatures for? Historically, they were the best way to model truly dynamic data.
* use Map: `Map<string, string>[]`
* While this may feel tedious, it does ensure that your data actually has the shape you expect. 
* This pattern of doing data validation on a broad type (Map<string, string>) to get a more specific one (Rocket) is common in TypeScript.
* Maps work around some famous gotchas involving the prototype chain.
* If the problem with using an index signature is that string is too broad, then you can use a `Record`. 
* Record is a built-in wrapper around a mapped type (Item 15).

### Item17: Avoid numeric index signatures

* JavaScript does not have a notion of ‚Äúhashable‚Äù objects like you find in Python or Java.
* In particular, numbers cannot be used as keys. If you try to use a number as a property name, the JavaScript runtime will convert it to a string
* TypeScript models this by allowing numeric keys and distinguishing between these and strings. This is purely a fiction‚Äîstring keys are accepted at runtime as the ECMAScript standard dictates that they must‚Äîbut it is a helpful one that can catch mistakes:

### Chapter 3: Type inference and control flow Analysis

* In most languages, a variable has a type and it never changes. TypeScript is a bit different. A variable has a type at a location in your code. The process by which its type changes due to surrounding code is known as control flow analysis.

### Item18: Avoid cluttering with Inferable types

* Object literals for excess property checking
* function has multiple return statements, if it‚Äôs part of a public API, or if you want to use a named return type
  
### Item19: Use different variables for different types

* Union types are harder to work with than simple types like string or number because you usually have to check what they are before you do anything with them.

### Item20: Understand how a variable get its type

* `satisfies Record<string, Point>` This is an improvement over a const assertion because it will report the error where you define the object, rather than where you use it.

* Understand how TypeScript infers a type from a literal by widening it.Familiarize yourself with the ways you can affect this behavior: const, type annotations, context, helper functions, as const, and satisfies.

### Item21: Create Objects all at once

* Prefer to build objects all at once rather than piecemeal.
* Use multiple objects and object spread syntax ({...a, ...b}) to add properties in a type-safe way.
* Know how to conditionally add properties to an object.

### Item22: Understand Type Narrowing

* Also known as Control Flow Analysis. But in TypeScript, a symbol has a type at a location. 
* `if`, `instanceof`, property check, `isArray` 
* falsy primitive values: null, empty string, 0
* *tagged/discriminated union*. `switch` #item59
* special function "user-defined type guard"
* The issue is that TypeScript doesn‚Äôt understand the relationship between the has and get methods of a `Map`. It doesn‚Äôt know that checking has eliminates the possibility of undefined in a subsequent lookup with get
* This pattern is common and can be written more concisely using the ‚Äúnullish coalescing‚Äù operator (??)
* Callbacks DON'T narrow

### Item23: Be consistent in the use of aliases

* We‚Äôre using two names for the same thing: This is a distinction without a difference (Item 41).
* So TypeScript makes the pragmatic choice to assume the function does not invalidate its type refinements. Item 48 discusses other situations like this where TypeScript trades safety for convenience.
* Be aware of how function calls can invalidate type refinements on properties. Trust refinements on local variables more than on properties.

### Item24: Understand how context is used in type inference

* string literals, tuple, object, callbacks, 

### Item25: Understand evolving types

* "evolving arrays"
* Improved type inference is a good reason to prefer for-of loops to forEach loops in TypeScript.

### Item26: Use Fn constructs and libraries

* lodash and underscore

### Item27: Use async

### Item28: Uses classes and currying to create new inference sites

* Prefer the currying approach if you‚Äôd like to create a local type alias.

## Chapter 4: Type Design

### Item29: Prefer types that represent valid states

* state.error vs state.loading

### **Item30**: Liberal in what you accept, strict in what you produce !!

* Postel's Law - robustness principle. (TCP net protocol)
* Input types tend to be broader than output types. Optional properties and union types are more common in parameter types than return types.
* Avoid broad return types since these will be awkward for clients to use.
* To reuse types between parameters and return types, introduce a canonical form (for return types) and a looser form (for parameters).
* Use `Iterable<T>` instead of `T[]` if you only need to iterate over your function parameter

### Item31: Don't repeat type info in doc
### Item32: Avoid include null or undefined in type aliases

* ...or write NullableVar
* Avoid defining type aliases that include null or undefined.

### Item33: Push null values to the perimeter 

* Avoid designs in which one value being null or not null is implicitly related to another value being null or not null.
* Push null values to the perimeter of your API by making larger objects either null or fully non-null. This will make code clearer both for human readers and for the type checker.
* Consider creating a fully non-null class and constructing it when all values are available.

### Item34: Prefer Unions of interfaces to interfaces with unions

* Interfaces with multiple properties that are union types are often a mistake because they obscure the relationships between these properties.
* Unions of interfaces are more precise and can be understood by TypeScript.
* Use tagged unions to facilitate control flow analysis. `type Layer = FillLayer | LineLayer | PointLayer;`
* Consider whether multiple optional properties could be grouped to more accurately model your data.

### Item35: Precise alternatives to string types

* Prefer keyof T to string for function parameters that are expected to be properties of an object.

```ts
function pluck<T>(record: T[], key: keyof T): T[keyof T][];

function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(records: T[], key: K): T[K][] {
  return records.map(r => r[key]);
}
```

### Item36: Distinct type for special values

* Avoid special values that are assignable to regular values in a type. They will reduce TypeScript‚Äôs ability to find bugs in your code.
* Prefer null or undefined as a special value instead of 0, -1, or "".
* Consider using a tagged union rather than null or undefined if the meaning of those values isn‚Äôt clear.

### Item37: Limit optional properties

* Optional properties can prevent the type checker from finding bugs and can lead to repeated and possibly inconsistent code for filling in default values.
* Think twice before adding an optional property to an interface. Consider whether you could make it required instead.
* Consider creating distinct types for un-normalized input data and normalized data for use in your code.
* Avoid a combinatorial explosion of options

### Item38: Avoid repeated parameters of same type

* Avoid writing functions that take consecutive parameters with the same TypeScript type.
* Refactor functions that take many parameters to take fewer parameters with distinct types, or a single object parameter.

### Item39: Prefer unifying types to modeling differences

* camelCase vs snake_version (accept superficial inconsistency)

### Item40: Prefer imprecise types to inacurate types

* Avoid the uncanny valley of type safety: complex but inaccurate types are often worse than simpler, less precise types. If you cannot model a type accurately, do not model it inaccurately! Acknowledge the gaps using any or unknown.
* Pay attention to error messages and autocomplete as you make typings increasingly precise. It‚Äôs not just about correctness: developer experience matters, too.
* As your types grow more complex, your test suite for them should expand.


### Item41: Name types with problem domain

### Item42: Avoid types of anectdotal data

* What if there‚Äôs no spec or official schema available? Then you‚Äôll have to generate types from data. Tools like quicktype can help with this.
