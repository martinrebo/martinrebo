# Efficient TS

## Chapter 1: Getting to know TS

* TypeScript is an unusual language in that it neither runs in an interpreter (as Python and Ruby do) nor compiles down to a lower-level language (as Java and C do). Instead, it compiles to another high-level language, JavaScript.

### Item1: TS vs JS

* TS superset of JS

### Item2: TS Options

* use `noImplicitAny`
* for `stricNullChecks` add check/narrowing (`if (propertyExists)`) or non-null assertion (`propertyExists!.context`) - #Item9
* use `strict` > ðŸ‘€ `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` - #Item48

### Item3: Code is independent of Types

* Cannot check types at runtime
* Interfaces are only types. Classes have type and value, they can be checked at runtime
* Code with type errors can produce output
* `noEmitOnError` to disable output on errors
* Type Operations cannot affect runtime values (`(val) => vas as number`)
* Runtime types may not the same as Declared types. "Unsound" types - #Item 48
* Cannot overload a fn based on TS types (c++ feature). Only works on type level
* You can provide multiple type signatures for a fn, but only a single implementation
* TS no effect on runtime performance (build time - and perfomance overhead vs native eg. generators)

### Item4: Structural Typing

* Ok to have different name types with same structure
* It can cause code errors as types are "open" not precise - #Item63 + #Item64 
* Excess property checking - #Item11
* Iterating over objects - #Item60
* Structural typing can lead to surprises on classes too!
* Can help to abstract dependencies on tests (no mocking libraries necessary) - #Item70

### Item5: Limit `any`

* No type safety
* Allows break contracts
* No language service (no infer, no rename Symbols)
* Masks bugs on refactoring
* Hides type design
* Undermines confidence on the type sys
