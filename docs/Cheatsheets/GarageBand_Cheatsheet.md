## 🎚️ 4. Mixing Vocals (Smart Controls - `B`)

### 🎛️ Essential FX Chain for Vocals

| Effect         | Purpose                            | Tips                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compressor** | Balances loud/soft parts           | Use presets like "Vocal" or adjust threshold/ratio manually         |
| **EQ**         | Removes mud, boosts clarity        | - Cut low frequencies (below 80Hz) <br> - Boost 3–6kHz for presence |
| **Reverb**     | Adds space and depth               | Use subtly (e.g., "PlatinumVerb")                                   |
| **Delay**      | Creates width or echo              | Use stereo delay or slapback subtly                                 |
| **De-Esser**   | Reduces harsh "S" sounds           | Found under "Dynamics" in plug-ins                                  |
| **Noise Gate** | Removes low-level background noise | Set threshold just below quietest vocals                            |

### Example Vocal Preset Stack

```text
Channel EQ → Compressor → De-Esser → Reverb → Limiter
```

✅ Use **Visual EQ** to manually shape frequencies.

---

## ✨ 5. Vocal Processing Tips

### 🎵 For Singing

* **Double Track** vocals: Copy and slightly pan L/R.
* Use **Pitch Correction** (in Smart Controls):

  * Set key of song.
  * Use sparingly for natural sound.
* Add **harmonies** with duplicate track + pitch shift.

### 🎙 For Podcasts / Voiceovers

* Use **Narration Vocal Preset**.
* Focus on clarity:

  * EQ → Compressor → Noise Gate → De-Esser
* Normalize volume before exporting:

  * `Mix > Normalize` or manually with Limiter.

---

## 🔁 6. Advanced Techniques

* **Comping Takes**:

  * Record multiple takes (loops).
  * Right-click > "Show Take Folder".
  * Select best parts from each take.

* **Automation (A)**:

  * Automate volume fades, FX on/off, emphasis.
  * Draw curves for smoother transitions.

* **Bus Effects (via Mixer X)**:

  * Route vocal to a bus (e.g., Reverb Bus).
  * Save CPU and maintain consistency.

## 📤 7. Exporting Vocals

| Task                  | How to Do It                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Export Isolated Vocal | Solo vocal track → `Share > Export Song` |
| Export for Podcast    | `Share > Export to Disk` as AAC or AIFF  |
| Export Stems          | Solo each track → Export one at a time   |
| Share to Music        | `Share > Song to Music`                  |

## 🎧 Detailed Vocal Chains by Style

### 🎤 HIP-HOP VOCALS

**Vocal Goals**: Clarity, rhythm, presence.

**Recommended Presets**: "Vocal Hip Hop", "Classic Vocal", or custom.

**FX Chain Example**:

```text
1. Channel EQ — Cut lows below 80Hz, boost 2–6kHz for presence  
2. Compressor — Fast attack, medium ratio (~3:1)  
3. De-Esser — Target 4–7kHz for sharp "S"  
4. Saturation (Bitcrusher or Overdrive) — Subtle grit  
5. Delay (Stereo or Ping Pong) — Tail effects, NOT reverb
```

**Tips**:

* Use tight **quantization** on vocal layers.
* Stack **ad-libs** and **doubles**, pan slightly.
* Use **automation** to highlight punchlines.

---

### 🎵 POP VOCALS

**Vocal Goals**: Smooth, emotional, "radio-ready".

**Recommended Presets**: "Pop Vocal", "Bright Vocal", or custom.

**FX Chain Example**:

```text
1. Pitch Correction — Key-locked, subtle  
2. Channel EQ — Sculpt mids (1–5kHz), de-mud lows  
3. Compressor — Transparent, low ratio (~2:1)  
4. Reverb — Plate or Hall, lush but clean  
5. Delay — Slapback or 1/8 note for dimension  
```

**Tips**:

* **Double track chorus** for depth.
* Use **automation** for vocal swells.
* **Air frequencies** (\~10kHz+) can be boosted for sheen.

---

### 🎸 ROCK VOCALS

**Vocal Goals**: Aggressive, expressive, raw.

**Recommended Presets**: "Rock Vocal", "Grunge Vocal", or custom.

**FX Chain Example**:

```text
1. Channel EQ — High-pass below 100Hz, boost mids  
2. Compressor — Harder compression, fast attack  
3. Overdrive or Saturation — Edge & warmth  
4. Reverb — Room or Spring, vintage vibe  
5. Optional: Chorus or Flanger for 90s/alt sounds  
```

**Tips**:

* Let **dynamics** breathe; don’t overcompress.
* Record with emotional delivery; "imperfections" add energy.
* For screams: use **clip gain** + EQ instead of FX overkill.

---

### 🎙 PODCAST VOCALS

**Vocal Goals**: Intelligibility, warmth, consistency.

**Recommended Presets**: "Narration Vocal", "Podcasting", or custom.

**FX Chain Example**:

```text
1. Channel EQ — Cut sub-80Hz, soften 2–4kHz if harsh  
2. Compressor — Medium ratio (~4:1), tame peaks  
3. De-Esser — Focus 5–7kHz (sibilance)  
4. Noise Gate — Set just under quietest words  
5. Limiter — Prevent clipping, boost loudness
```

**Tips**:

* Use **room treatment** or RX noise tools for echo removal.
* Maintain a **constant distance** from the mic.
* Export in **mono** unless multitrack, and normalize before publishing.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips for All Styles

* Record in **48kHz** for better editing headroom.
* Use **Take folders** for comping multiple performances.
* Create a **template project** for your preferred vocal chain.
* Always **check mixes** on different speakers (laptop, phone, car, headphones).
