# 🤖 Learning Artificial Intelligence: Roadmap for Full-Stack Developers

AI is no longer just a niche for data scientists—it's now a vital skill for full-stack developers who want to stay ahead. If you're comfortable with JavaScript, APIs, and databases, you're already halfway there.

This guide will walk you through a clear roadmap to transition from full-stack to AI-enhanced developer: what to learn, where to learn it, and how to build a solid AI project portfolio. 🧠🚀

## 🛣️ 1. Roadmap: From Full-Stack Dev to AI Developer

Here’s a progressive roadmap tailored for full-stack developers who want to break into AI:

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundations
- **Brush up Math Basics**: Linear algebra, probability, stats
- **Python for AI**: Learn Python + libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib
- **Understand ML Concepts**:
  - Supervised vs unsupervised learning
  - Overfitting, underfitting
  - Loss functions, optimization

### 🔹 Phase 2: Core AI/ML
- **Scikit-learn** for classic ML algorithms (SVM, KNN, decision trees)
- **Neural networks** basics using TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Build LLM-based apps** with OpenAI or open-source models

### 🔹 Phase 3: Full-Stack AI Integration
- Connect LLMs with your web stack (Node.js/Express/React)
- Use **LangChain / LlamaIndex** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Deploy models with Docker + FastAPI/Flask
- Integrate **vector databases** (Pinecone, Chroma)

### 🔹 Phase 4: Advanced Topics
- Fine-tuning models
- Multi-agent systems
- Reinforcement learning
- Ethics, hallucination handling, and interpretability

## 🧠 4. Key Skills to Develop

Here are essential skills for full-stack devs diving into AI:

| Category | Skills |
|---------|--------|
| **Programming** | Python, JS/TS, async/REST |
| **ML Frameworks** | Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow |
| **LLM Tools** | OpenAI API, LangChain, LlamaIndex |
| **DevOps** | Docker, GitHub Actions, API hosting |
| **Data Handling** | pandas, JSON, CSV, prompt chaining |
